Grammar Basics Guide
===================

Grammar is the foundation of clear communication and effective writing.

Parts of Speech:
- Nouns: People, places, things, ideas (student, school, book, freedom)
- Pronouns: Replace nouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, this, that)
- Verbs: Action or state words (run, eat, be, have, do)
- Adjectives: Describe nouns (big, red, happy, intelligent)
- Adverbs: Describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (quickly, very, well)
- Prepositions: Show relationships (in, on, at, with, for, by)
- Conjunctions: Connect words/clauses (and, but, or, so, because, although)
- Interjections: Express emotion (wow, oh, hey, ouch)

Sentence Structure:
- Subject: Who/what the sentence is about
- Predicate: What the subject does or is
- Complete sentences have both subject and predicate
- Fragments: Incomplete sentences missing subject or predicate
- Run-ons: Two complete sentences joined incorrectly

Subject-Verb Agreement:
- Singular subjects take singular verbs (The dog barks)
- Plural subjects take plural verbs (The dogs bark)
- Compound subjects joined by "and" are plural (Tom and Jerry play)
- Subjects joined by "or" agree with the nearer subject (Either the dog or the cats bark)

Verb Tenses:
- Present: I eat, I am eating (habitual or ongoing action)
- Past: I ate, I was eating (completed action)
- Future: I will eat, I am going to eat (action that will happen)
- Present Perfect: I have eaten (action completed at unspecified time)
- Past Perfect: I had eaten (action completed before another past action)
- Future Perfect: I will have eaten (action completed before future time)

Pronoun Usage:
- Personal: I, me, you, he, him, she, her, it, we, us, they, them
- Possessive: my, your, his, her, its, our, their
- Reflexive: myself, yourself, himself, herself, ourselves, themselves
- Relative: who, whom, whose, which, that
- Avoid pronoun confusion and unclear antecedents

Common Grammar Rules:
- I vs Me: Use "I" as subject, "me" as object
- Who vs Whom: "Who" is subject, "whom" is object
- Its vs It's: "Its" shows possession, "it's" means "it is"
- Your vs You're: "Your" shows possession, "you're" means "you are"
- There vs Their vs They're: Location, possession, "they are"
- Affect vs Effect: "Affect" is verb, "effect" is noun

Punctuation:
- Period (.): Ends declarative sentences and abbreviations
- Question Mark (?): Ends questions
- Exclamation Point (!): Shows strong emotion
- Comma (,): Separates items, clauses, and phrases
- Semicolon (;): Joins related independent clauses
- Colon (:): Introduces lists or explanations
- Apostrophe ('): Shows possession or contractions
- Quotation Marks (" "): Enclose direct speech or titles
- Parentheses ( ): Contain additional information
- Hyphen (-): Joins compound words
- Dash (—): Shows interruption or emphasis

Capitalization:
- First word of sentences
- Proper nouns (names, places, organizations)
- Days, months, holidays (but not seasons)
- Titles of books, movies, songs
- "I" is always capitalized
- First word after colon in some cases

Common Errors to Avoid:
- Double negatives: "I don't have no money"
- Dangling modifiers: "Running down the street, the mailbox was hit"
- Misplaced modifiers: "I almost ate all the pizza"
- Parallel structure: "I like swimming, biking, and to run"
- Split infinitives: "To boldly go where no one has gone before"

Active vs Passive Voice:
- Active: Subject performs the action (The dog chased the cat)
- Passive: Subject receives the action (The cat was chased by the dog)
- Active voice is usually clearer and more direct

Word Choice and Usage:
- Homophones: Words that sound alike but are spelled differently
  (their/there/they're, to/too/two, accept/except)
- Homographs: Words spelled the same but pronounced differently
  (lead/lead, read/read, present/present)
- Synonyms: Words with similar meanings (big/large/huge)
- Antonyms: Words with opposite meanings (hot/cold, happy/sad)

Practice Tips:
- Read widely to see grammar in context
- Write regularly and self-edit
- Use grammar checkers as tools, not crutches
- Learn rules gradually, don't try to memorize everything at once
- Focus on common errors you personally make
