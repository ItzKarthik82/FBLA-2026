Biology Fundamentals Guide
==========================

Biology is the study of life and living organisms.

Cell Theory:
- All living things are made of cells
- Cells are the basic unit of life
- All cells come from pre-existing cells

Cell Structure:
- Cell Membrane: Controls what enters/exits the cell
- Cytoplasm: Jelly-like substance inside the cell
- Nucleus: Control center containing DNA
- Mitochondria: Powerhouses that produce energy
- Ribosomes: Protein factories
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Transportation system
- Golgi Apparatus: Packaging and shipping

Cell Types:
- Prokaryotic: No nucleus (bacteria)
- Eukaryotic: Has nucleus (plants, animals, fungi)

DNA and Genetics:
- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, genetic material
- Genes: Segments of DNA that code for traits
- Chromosomes: Structures containing DNA
- Mitosis: Cell division for growth
- Meiosis: Cell division for reproduction

Evolution:
- Natural Selection: Survival of the fittest
- Adaptation: Changes that help organisms survive
- Speciation: Formation of new species
- Fossil Record: Evidence of past life

Ecology:
- Ecosystem: Community of organisms and environment
- Food Chain: Energy flow through organisms
- Biodiversity: Variety of life
- Symbiosis: Relationships between organisms
  - Mutualism: Both benefit
  - Parasitism: One benefits, one harmed
  - Commensalism: One benefits, other unaffected

Human Biology:
- Organ Systems: Groups of organs working together
- Circulatory System: Transports blood and nutrients
- Respiratory System: Gas exchange
- Digestive System: Breaks down food
- Nervous System: Controls body functions
- Immune System: Fights disease

Photosynthesis:
- Process where plants make food using sunlight
- 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Cellular Respiration:
- Process where cells release energy from food
- C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy

Scientific Method:
1. Observe
2. Question
3. Hypothesis
4. Experiment
5. Analyze
6. Conclusion
