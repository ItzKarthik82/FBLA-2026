Algebra Essentials Guide
========================

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.

Variables and Constants:
- Variables: Letters that represent unknown values (x, y, z)
- Constants: Fixed values (2, 3.14, π)

Basic Operations:
- Addition: x + 5 = 10
- Subtraction: x - 3 = 7
- Multiplication: 2x = 8
- Division: x/2 = 4

Solving Linear Equations:
1. Isolate the variable on one side
2. Use inverse operations
3. Check your solution

Example: Solve 2x + 3 = 7
- Subtract 3: 2x = 4
- Divide by 2: x = 2

Quadratic Equations:
ax² + bx + c = 0
Use quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac))/(2a)

Factoring:
- Find two numbers that multiply to give ac and add to give b
- Example: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

Systems of Equations:
- Method of substitution
- Method of elimination
- Graphing

Word Problems:
1. Define variables
2. Write equations
3. Solve
4. Check answer

Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to perform the same operation on both sides
- Incorrect order of operations
- Sign errors when distributing

Practice regularly and check your work!
