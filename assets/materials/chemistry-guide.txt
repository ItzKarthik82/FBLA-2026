Chemistry Fundamentals Guide
=============================

Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and transformations.

Matter and Energy:
- Matter: Anything that has mass and takes up space
- States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma
- Energy: Ability to do work
- Chemical vs Physical Changes

Atomic Structure:
- Atom: Smallest unit of an element
- Protons: Positive charge, in nucleus
- Neutrons: No charge, in nucleus
- Electrons: Negative charge, orbiting nucleus
- Atomic Number: Number of protons
- Mass Number: Protons + neutrons
- Isotopes: Atoms of same element with different neutrons

Periodic Table:
- Elements arranged by atomic number
- Groups: Vertical columns (similar properties)
- Periods: Horizontal rows
- Metals: Left side, shiny, conduct electricity
- Nonmetals: Right side, dull, poor conductors
- Metalloids: Properties of both

Chemical Bonding:
- Ionic Bonds: Transfer of electrons
- Covalent Bonds: Sharing of electrons
- Metallic Bonds: Sea of electrons
- Lewis Dot Structures: Show valence electrons

Chemical Reactions:
- Reactants → Products
- Types: Synthesis, Decomposition, Single Replacement, Double Replacement, Combustion
- Balancing Equations: Equal atoms on both sides
- Law of Conservation of Mass: Matter cannot be created or destroyed

Acids and Bases:
- Acids: Donate H+ ions, sour taste, pH < 7
- Bases: Accept H+ ions, bitter taste, pH > 7
- pH Scale: 0-14
- Neutral: pH = 7
- Indicators: Show acid/base strength

Solutions:
- Solvent: Dissolving medium
- Solute: Substance being dissolved
- Concentration: Amount of solute per solvent
- Molarity: Moles per liter
- Dilution: Adding solvent to decrease concentration

Stoichiometry:
- Mole: 6.02 × 10²³ particles
- Molar Mass: Mass of one mole
- Limiting Reactant: Reactant that runs out first
- Percent Yield: Actual vs theoretical yield

Gas Laws:
- Boyle's Law: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ (pressure-volume)
- Charles's Law: V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂ (volume-temperature)
- Gay-Lussac's Law: P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂ (pressure-temperature)
- Combined Gas Law: P₁V₁/T₁ = P₂V₂/T₂

Thermodynamics:
- Endothermic: Absorbs heat
- Exothermic: Releases heat
- Activation Energy: Energy needed to start reaction
- Catalyst: Speeds up reaction without being consumed

Organic Chemistry:
- Carbon-based compounds
- Hydrocarbons: Carbon and hydrogen
- Functional Groups: Determine properties
- Polymers: Long chain molecules

Nuclear Chemistry:
- Radioactivity: Unstable nuclei decay
- Alpha, Beta, Gamma radiation
- Half-life: Time for half to decay
- Nuclear Fission: Splitting atoms
- Nuclear Fusion: Combining atoms
