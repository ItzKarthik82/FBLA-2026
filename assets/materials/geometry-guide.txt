Geometry Fundamentals Guide
============================

Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space.

Points, Lines, and Planes:
- Point: A location with no size (represented by a dot)
- Line: Straight path extending infinitely in both directions
- Plane: Flat surface extending infinitely

Angles:
- Acute: Less than 90°
- Right: Exactly 90°
- Obtuse: Greater than 90° but less than 180°
- Straight: 180°
- Reflex: Greater than 180°

Angle Relationships:
- Vertical angles: Equal
- Adjacent angles: Sum to 180°
- Complementary angles: Sum to 90°
- Supplementary angles: Sum to 180°

Triangles:
- Sum of interior angles: 180°
- Types: Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene
- Area: (base × height) ÷ 2
- Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c²

Quadrilaterals:
- Rectangle: Opposite sides equal, 4 right angles
- Square: All sides equal, 4 right angles
- Parallelogram: Opposite sides parallel and equal
- Trapezoid: At least one pair of parallel sides

Circles:
- Circumference: 2πr or πd
- Area: πr²
- Diameter: 2r
- Radius: d/2

Coordinate Geometry:
- Distance formula: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
- Midpoint formula: ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2)
- Slope: (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁)

Transformations:
- Translation: Slide
- Rotation: Turn around a point
- Reflection: Mirror image
- Dilation: Size change

Proofs:
- Use given information
- Apply theorems and postulates
- Logical reasoning
- Two-column proofs

Volume and Surface Area:
- Cube: V = s³, SA = 6s²
- Rectangular Prism: V = lwh, SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)
- Cylinder: V = πr²h, SA = 2πr² + 2πrh
- Sphere: V = (4/3)πr³, SA = 4πr²
